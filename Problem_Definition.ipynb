    "## ⚡Waste Classification using CNN for Sustainability\n",
    "---\n",
    "### 💠Problem Statement\n",
    "One of the major challenges in achieving sustainable waste management is improper waste segregation. Due to a lack of awareness or time, people often dispose of recyclable and non-recyclable materials together, which pollutes the environment and results in ineffective recycling procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop an *AI-based waste classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)* to automatically identify the type of waste—such as plastic, paper, metal, glass, or organic matter—from images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to classification, the system seeks to promote sustainability by providing recommendations for responsible disposal or recycling, thus supporting environmentally conscious waste management.\n",
    "### 💠Objective\n",
    "- To build and train a CNN model capable of accurately classifying waste images into predefined categories.\n",
    "- To automate waste identification in order to facilitate proper segregation and recycling.\n",
    "- To incorporate sustainability recommendations for each predicted waste type, encouraging responsible disposal.\n",
    "- To illustrate an ML-based approach to environmental awareness that is easy to use, effective, and readily available.\n",
    "### 💠Dataset Description\n",
    "This project uses the **Custom Waste classification dataset** from Kaggle. The dataset is split into *training* and *testing* sets. The training set contains *9,213* labeled images, and the test set consists of *2,309* labeled images.The dataset includes images categorized into *9* types of waste for enhanced recycling and waste management :\n",
